    <h1>Today is my 1st day in CSS</h1>

    <p>
      Hey there, I know today might feel like a heavy one, but remember this:
      even the strongest storms eventually pass, leaving behind clearer skies
      and fresh beginnings. Youâ€™ve faced challenges before, and each one has
      only made you stronger and wiser. Trust in your resilience, and give
      yourself the grace to feel what you need to feel. Take a deep breath,
      focus on just one small, positive step forward, and know that brighter
      moments are on their way. Youâ€™ve got this, one moment at a time. ðŸ’› With
      belief in you, [Your Name]
    </p>
